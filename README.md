# VS Code â€” Markdown to HTML

<img alt="Latest Release" src="https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/sakryukov.convert-markdown-to-html.svg"/>

This extension reads Markdown content from a currently active editor, converts it to HTML and saves it in a file.
The extension depends on the built-in extension "VS Code Markdown" (`id="Microsoft.vscode-markdown"`) and augments it.

## Usage

Open Markdown file (.md) in Visual Studio Code and activate the editor's context menu, use the command "Markdown: Convert to HTML", to convert this file.

All files found in a currently opened workspace can be converted at once with the command "Markdown: Convert to HTML all .md files in workspace". This command appears in context menu of any editor, and also in the Explorer context menu.

Alternatively, open the Command Palette ("Ctrl+Shift+P"/"Cmd+Shift+P" or F1) and search for the command "Markdown: Convert to HTML" or "Markdown: Convert to HTML all .md files in workspace".

The HTML file is saved to the same directory as original Markdown file.

## Settings

The extension introduces two options:   

- "markdown.extension.convertToHtml.reportSuccess" shows the message upon successful conversion, reports the names of the input and output files.
- "markdown.extension.convertToHtml.showHtmlInBrowser" opens generated HTML file in the default browser.

This is the fragment of the file "settings.json" file ([user or workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)):

```json
{
    "markdown.extension.convertToHtml.reportSuccess": true, // default
    "markdown.extension.convertToHtml.showHtmlInBrowser": false, // default
    "markdown.styles": [
        "style.css" // same style to be used for preview and converted file
    ],

    // ...
	
    "cSpell.enabled": true
}
```

The extension also uses "markdown.styles" option related to the extension "VS Code Markdown". If one of more CSS files is defined, first file name is used in the generated HTML file as an *external style sheet*. The user is responsible for supplying the CSS file itself.
